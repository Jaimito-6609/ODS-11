Yigitcanlar et. al (2020) review the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on 
the development of smart cities, addressing sectors such as business, 
education, energy, health, and transportation. The study highlights how AI 
influences urban sustainability, its disruptive benefits, and challenges and 
opportunities for future research. They highlight the importance of analyzing 
the potential risks and disruptions of AI in urban planning. 

YiÄŸitcanlar, T., Desouza, K. C., Butler, L., & Roozkhosh, F. (2020). 
Contributions and Risks of  Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Building Smarter 
Cities: Insights from a Systematic Review of the Literature. Energies, 13(6), 
1473. https://doi.org/10.3390/en13061473.

The provided Python code implements an algorithm to analyze the impact of 
artificial intelligence (AI) on the development of smart cities by clustering 
cities based on various sectoral indicators (business, education, energy, 
                                             health, and transportation). 
The dataset, assumed to contain relevant sectoral information, is first 
normalized to ensure equal contribution from all features. KMeans clustering 
is then applied to group the cities into clusters with similar characteristics. 
The algorithm further analyzes and visualizes the cluster centers to 
understand the common traits within each cluster. Additionally, it highlights 
potential risks and opportunities for AI in urban planning by examining the 
cluster characteristics, saving the analysis results for further examination.
